# Sabertooth

Sabertooth is an experimental app with mainly three objectives:

1. Learn about the Mastodon API
2. Showcase my
   own [project structure][jedi01]
3. Have a usable Mastodon API compliant web client for KaiOS devices.

I current test the interface on a Nokia 8110 4G (a.k.a. the Bananaphone), with a total screen resolution of 240x320
pixels.

## About the Name

It's a callback to Mighty Morphin Power Rangers. As my Bananaphone is yellow, I choose to name the app after the Yellow
Ranger's "Dinozord".
